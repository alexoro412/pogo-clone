# Installing

## Dependencies
* You will need Redis running on port 6379
* MongoDB must be running on port 27017

```
yarn add
redis-server
mongod
node index.js
```

# Caveats
* Allow the server to run for a few minutes so the pokemon can spawn
* Only works around Kent Denver School campus
* The server only responds on `https://localhost:3000`
